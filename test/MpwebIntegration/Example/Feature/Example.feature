Feature: something really really stupid...
  As a sane person
  I want to make sure that true is true
  So that the World doesn't implode

  Scenario: doing nasty stuff
    Given a value x that I don't really need
    And temporary storing another value y
    When executing the dummy class
    Then the result should be true
    And the temporary value should still be there
